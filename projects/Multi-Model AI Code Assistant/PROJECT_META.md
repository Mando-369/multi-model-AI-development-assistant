## Vision & Goals
(Describe the project purpose and success criteria)

## Current Roadmap

| Milestone | Status | Target | Notes |
|-----------|--------|--------|-------|
| Define project scope | planned | - | - |

## Architecture Decisions

| Decision | Date | Rationale | Status |
|----------|------|-----------|--------|
| - | - | - | - |

## Agent Handoffs
(Define which specialist agent handles which aspects)

- **FAUST**: DSP algorithms, signal processing code
- **JUCE**: Plugin architecture, C++ implementation
- **Math**: Algorithm derivations, filter design
- **Physics**: Circuit modeling, acoustics

## Export Queue (Ready for Claude Code)
(Items refined enough for implementation - copy these to your coding tool)

-

## Completed Work
(Historical log of completed milestones and exported items)

-

## Cross-Cutting Concerns
(Shared patterns, conventions, technical debt, notes that span multiple agents)
